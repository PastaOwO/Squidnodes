# Downloading Squidnodes

The Squidnodes addon works a bit differently than other addons. This is to simplify installation, and to make updates to Blender easier to manage.

## Step-By-Step Process

1. Download the Squidnodes.blend file from our distribution page here: https://github.com/PastaOwO/Squidnodes
2. Save the file to somewhere that you can access easily
3. Either create a new blend file, or open an existing one
4. Under the "File" dropdown menu, select "Append"
5. Locate the Squidnodes.blend file
6. A folder labelled "NodeTree" should be present. Click into this folder
7. Select everything inside the folder and tick the "Fake User" box on the right hand side of the file dialog 
8. Click "Append"
9. Import your model and set it up as you wish
10. In the shader editor, search for "Squidnodes" in the "Add" dropdown menu
11. If all goes well, you should see the addon's shaders right there!
